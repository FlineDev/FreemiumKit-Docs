# Paid to Freemium Migration Guide

Learn how to migrate from a paid-up-front app to the Freemium model using FreemiumKit in 3 simple steps, while preserving access to your app for those who already purchased.

## Step 1: Set up FreemiumKit like normally

Add your app inside the FreemiumKit app and follow all instructions to set up your app for In-App Purchases like you would normally do (see Setup tab inside the Mac app). Just act like your app is already free to use and make sure to lock any features you want to hide behind paid tiers using the SDK features from our <doc:SetupGuide>.

## Step 2: Tell our SDK the last paid version

In order to continue giving users who had already purchased your app previously full access to your apps features, you need to tell our SDK which was the last version and build number sold as a paid-up-front app. Our SDK will then use Apples [built-in solution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/supporting_business_model_changes_by_using_the_app_transaction) in StoreKit to automatically detect those users for you, there's nothing else you need to do. Just call this, e.g. in your app entry point:

```swift
import FreemiumKit

@main
struct AwesomeApp: App {
   init() {
      FreemiumKit.shared.lastPaidRelease(version: "1.5.1", buildNum: 25)
   }
   // ...
}
```

> Requirements: Apple has introduced the `AppTransaction` API for this purpose in 2022 with iOS 16. Therefore, this guide only works if you target your _new_ Freemium app version to iOS 16 (or macOS 13, tvOS 16, watchOS 9) or later.

> Warning: The `AppTransaction` API Apple offers to detect the first downloaded app version returns the version (e.g. `1.5.1`) on macOS but the build number (e.g. `25`) on all other platforms, including iOS. But only on macOS of all platforms (where it's not relevant) Apple requires new versions to have a _higher_ build number, but not on iOS, for example. As long as you increase the version number (e.g. from `1.5.1` to `1.5.2`) you can always go back to build number `1` even if you were at build `25` in version `1.5.1`.
>
> So for this check to work, make sure to **always** increase your build number from now on if you haven't already. Also, if you had been resetting your build number to `1` in the past, make sure to pass the highest build number you've ever shipped your app with when calling `lastPaidRelease(version:buildNum:)` and start with the next number for your future releases. E.g. if `5` was your latest released build number, but you had a version with build `25` in the past, pass `25` for the `buildNum` and start your build number at `26` for your next release.
>
> If it takes too long to figure out which was the highest build number, just pick a number that's sure to be higher than the highest build number so far (e.g. `500`) and start from there.

## Step 3: Submit a new version & make your app free

With everything ready and tested, set your app to "Manually release this version" and submit it to the App Store.

Once your update is approved, release your version and immediately after that set your app pricing to "Free". This will ensure that no one can download your previous (paid) version for free but also no one has to pay for the new Freemium version.

That's it, you successfully migrated your paid app to the Freemium model!

The FreemiumKit SDK will automatically treat any users who had paid for your app previously like someone who purchased your highest tier for Lifetime. This means calls to APIs like `PaidFeatureButton`, `purchasedTier` or `hasPurchased` will behave like for an active subscriber. üéâ

> Tip: If you want to particularly know if the current user is a paid-up-front puchaser who upgraded (e.g. to give them extras like an 'Early Adopter' badge), you can call `hasUpgradedFromPaidRelease` on `FreemiumKit.shared` or on the FreemiumKit `@EnvironmentObject`.
