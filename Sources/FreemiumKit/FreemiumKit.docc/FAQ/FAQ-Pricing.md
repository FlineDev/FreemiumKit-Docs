## Short Answer

We build the average of your last 2 months total revenue reported to App Store Connect across all apps. If you exceed your current plan, you no longer will be able to update the paywall remote configuration, you won't see the purchase stats, nor will you receive purchase notifications. But your app will continue to show your last paywall and purchases will continue to work in your apps.

## Full Answer

Income on App Store Connect can vary significantly, that's why we've build a flexible and fair system for you:

Your monthly income is calculated by building the **average of your last 2 months' total revenue**. This ensures that (1) you don't have to upgrade if you exceeded just for one month and (2) you can downgrade quickly again when your business takes an unexpected dip.

If you exceed your current plan, you don't need to worry, nothing bad will happen. Everything in your app will continue to work as expected, including the paywalls and your last remote configuration and purchases. But you won't be able to edit anything or see any data in FreemiumKit. So you will lose access to the paywall editor to adjust your paywall remotely or change A/B testing settings. You also won't be able to change your pricing through FreemiumKit or receive push notifications for live purchase stats. And you won't see your purchase history stats.

> Note: This is all how it's _planned_ to work. Currently, there's no payment at all and FreemiumKit is free to use for everyone. If you have any doubts about this system, don't hesitate to contact me, I might adjust things as needed.
