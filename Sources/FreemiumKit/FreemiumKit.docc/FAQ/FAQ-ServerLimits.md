## Short Answer

FreemiumKit uses the built-in `appDeviceToken` in StoreKit 2 to recognize the same user across app installs and devices. You can access it from the `FreemiumKit` instance either using the `@EnvironmentObject` method or globally via `FreemiumKit.shared.appDeviceToken`.

## Full Answer

If you have your own server-side logic for locking/unlocking functionality based on usage (such as '100 posts per month'), you will want to identify the same user across app installs or devices. To do this, you can access `appAccountToken` on the `FreemiumKit` environment object which will return a `UUID` stored right within StoreKit (so Apple makes sure you recognize the same user across devices ‚Äì we don't store that data on our servers).

Access the field after purchases are loaded like so:

```swift
import FreemiumKit

struct MyView: View {
   @EnvironmentObject private var freemiumKit: FreemiumKit

   var body: some View {
      VStack {
         // your main view ...
      }
      .onPurchasesLoaded {
         let appAccountToken: UUID = freemiumKit.appAccountToken
         // do something with the app account token
      }
   }
}
```

You can also access it globally via `FreemiumKit.shared.appAccountToken` but make sure that `FreemiumKit.shared.purchasesLoad` is `true`, else you won't get the correct `UUID`. Note that FreemiumKit loads this data upon app start and caches it, so most of the time it should be available.
