FreemiumKit is the ultimate solution for Apple platform developers to integrate and manage in-app purchases and subscriptions effortlessly. With support for all Apple platforms, FreemiumKit provides a seamless and efficient way to handle your app's monetization.

> Tip: Install the Mac app first for a smooth onboarding experience.

## Key Features

### One-Click Creation of Monthly/Yearly/Lifetime

- **Connect API Integration**: FreemiumKit connects to App Store Connect on your behalf to automate all the steps needed to create your products, saving you a lot of click & wait.
- **Automatic Pricing**: We even calculate the prices for longer periods by default based on your Monthly price in a sensible manner, giving you full control when needed.
- **Combined Review Note**: The review note updates for all of Monthly/Yearly/Lifetime at once.

- **Remote Config**: Paywalls update immediately so you don't need to wait for a new app version.
- **A/B Testing**: Improve your conversion by comparing up to 4 designs in parallel.

## FreemiumKit vs. RevenueCat

Many people in our community love 😻 RevenueCat, so you might wonder how FreemiumKit compares. The short answer is, that RevenueCat focuses on **growth** for _already successful_ customers, whereas FreemiumKit focuses on **convenience** for _beginners and Indie developers_. See the following table to get a better understanding of what I mean by that:
